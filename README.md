## How it's made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CocktailDB API

I really wanted to make it so when a drink is searched for, not only does it pop up, but an easily readable list of similar drinks would also appear below it and that's where most of my time was spent. 
I went with a horizontal reel because it was a cleaner look than giant grid expanding below and I didn't know how many drinks would pop up with each search so a grid may have been uneven in some cases.

### Optimizations 
1: Having the search autocomplete

2: Being able to search by multiple ingredients

### Lessons Learned:
Label everything. It's much easier to declare a variable and then writing something document.querySelector a bunch of times. It's also easier to keep track of everything when it's properly labeled rather than calling everything something like "p" or "h2".
